        <a href="http://www.jabadaw.co.uk/maverik">Martin</a>
        is one of the two founder members of Jabadaw. He started learning the
        piano at the age of 15, detoured by way of the hammered dulcimer, and
        eventually took up the hurdy-gurdy in 1992.<br/>
        <br/>He was once described by Nigel Eaton as a <q>teenage
        hurdy-gurdy whizzkid</q>, even though he was well into his 20s at the time.<br/>
        <br/>He also plays drums and melodeon (but doesn’t like to admit
        it). Other interests include pinball, juggling and being obsessed with
        (one of) the Spice Girls.
        In his spare time he likes to appear in TV adverts with Bob
        Mortimer.</br>
        <br/>Martin also played with Jabadaw Trio and in a duo with Miranda Rutter,
        and currently plays in <a href="https://myspace.com/laeftylo">Laefty Lo</a> and
        with Helena in <a href="https://myspace.com/duoskeller">Skeller</a>.</p>

        <a href="https://janiveer.github.io">Simon</a>
        is the other founder member of Jabadaw. His
        first instrument was the tin whistle, which he took up at the age of
        17. He soon branched out into other woodwind instruments, including the
        flute, before discovering the soprano saxophone in 1994.<br/>
        <br/>Simon also played with Fika, Jabadaw Trio and in a duo with Jo Veal.</p>

        Helena joined the band in September 2001 and played her first
        gig with us in the spring of 2002. She plays a Quinton 5-string fiddle
        and English half-long border bagpipes.<br/>
        <br/>A product of the irrepressible Sheffield folk scene, Helena
        has been playing folk music since the age of 18: she is particularly
        interested in French, Breton and English music. She also developed a
        love of Galician folk music when she lived in Santiago de Compostela.
        She’s mad about all kinds of dancing: English Ceilidh, Morris, French,
        Swedish, Galician... and anything else.<br/>
        <br/>She also plays with Martin in <a href="https://myspace.com/duoskeller">Skeller</a>.</p>

        alt="Photo of Peter Kenney &copy; Zoë Sutherland"
        title="Photo &copy; Zoë Sutherland">
        Peter played his first public gig with us at the
        <a href="http://www.strawbear.org.uk">Whittlesea Straw Bear Festival</a>
        in January 2003. His fretless bass adds more than a touch
        of jazz to Jabadaw’s rhythm section.<br/>
        <br/>When not turning out a well-crafted bassline, Peter is also a
        fine pianist, flautist and composer and is involved in the Sheffield
        folk and jazz scenes too.</p>
