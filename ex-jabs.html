        Douglas is a graduate of the Royal Northern College of Music
        in Manchester. He works as a professional drummer and percussionist.<br/>
        <br/>He was Jabadaw’s secondary drummer from March 1995, and became
        our main drummer a year later. Due to personal reasons he stopped
        working regularly with us in the spring of 2003.<br/>
        <br/>He comes from somewhere in Scotland, as far as we can tell.<br/>
        <br/>Douglas also played with Creak.</p>

        title="Photo &copy; Simon Dew">
        Stefan was Jabadaw’s first drummer and percussionist. He
        studied popular music at Salford University and worked as a
        professional musician.<br/>
        <br/>A superb drummer, he contributed inventive and original
        arrangement ideas for much of our early repertoire and played on our
        first demo tape, which WiggINCEilidhs
        said was <q>the best demo tape we’ve ever heard</q>.<br/>
        <br/>He had an uncanny ability to get to venues with the bare
        minimum of direction and ate a lot of polos.<br/>
        <br/>Stefan left Jabadaw when one of the other bands that he played
        in got signed. He played his last gig with us at Ringheye Ceilidhs in
        early 1996.</p>

        <p><strong>Bass Guitar</strong></p>
        <p><img src="simon.jpg" class="left"

        title="Photo &copy; Fiona Fahlin">
        Simon first picked
        up a guitar at the age of 12. In his teens he flirted with intense,
        introspective songwriting. However, in his early twenties he became a
        basically contented and happy person, a crippling blow from which his
        songwriting career never recovered. So he switched to bass guitar and
        played for several folk dance bands in the North of England before
        joining Jabadaw in 1995. He left in 1999 to concentrate on his PhD.<br/>
        <br/>He is hugely interested in folk storytelling, and spent years
        conducting postgraduate research at Sheffield University into the
        modern storytelling revival. (Was there a huge party when he finished
        his thesis? To be honest I can’t remember. Must have been good.) He now
        teaches and performs regularly as a singer, songwriter and storyteller.</p>

        Richard played for Jabadaw when Douglas was busy. He plays all
        styles of drumming, performing live and recording. He plays Yamaha
        drums and Zildjian cymbals. Richard’s other groups are
        <a href="http://www.lazy-eye.co.uk">Lazy Eye</a>,
        <a href="http://www.carrera-records.com">Iconic Phare</a>,
        and The Dean O’Shea Group. <br/>
        <br/>Richard is a self-confessed Sting obsessive. Well, it takes
        all sorts.</p>

        Not a character from a Star Wars movie, but Jabadaw’s funkiest ex-bassman.
        With an amp the size of a small building and a bass with more strings
        attached than a
        very stringy thing he more than made his presence felt on stage.<br/>
        <br/>He’s been described as a great bloke, musical superstar and
        general <a href="sexgod.jpg">sex-god</a>. Um, by himself, that is.<br/>
        <br/>After a superb festival season in 2002, we were stunned when
        he announced that he was hanging up his bass... to get a day job. In an
        office.</p>

        Pete played his first gig with Jabadaw at <a href="http://www.chippfolk.co.uk">Chippenham
        Folk Festival</a> in 2003 and started working regularly with us in
        December 2003. There is no truth in the rumour that Simon and Martin
        asked him to join so they would no longer be the oldest members of the
        band.<br/>
        <br/>Once described as <q>the RoboCop of the folk world</q>, Pete also
        plays saxophones and keyboards. He’s played in several rock, pop and
        soul bands, making appearances on The Old Grey Whistle Test and Top of
        the Pops.<br/>
        <br/>Pete left Jabadaw in 2006 to concentrate on his work with
        <a href="http://www.randomband-agency.com">The Cock and Bull Band</a> and

        <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&q=Mirranda+Rutter&s=nm">Miranda</a>
        comes from Sherborne, Dorset and started
        playing the viola in early childhood. She became interested in the
        English folk tradition and took up the violin in 1994. She also plays
        piano accordion. Her accordion teacher was Peter Shuttler of
        the Yetties.<br/>
        <br/>She joined the band in 1996, when she was studying social
        anthropology at Manchester University. (She got a first.) A musical
        perfectionist who always gave 100% in rehearsal or performance, she
        played with us at several major festivals and ceilidhs and recorded the
        Jabadaw Trio tape and our first CD with us.<br/>
        <br/>She left the band to go working and travelling through
        Australia and South America. She played her last gig with us at
        <a href="http://www.bromyard-folk-festival.org.uk">Bromyard
        Folk Festival</a> in 2001.<br/>
        <br/>Miranda also played with Fika, Jabadaw Trio, and in a duo with
        Dave Shepherd. She currently plays in <a href="http://www.methera.co.uk">Methera</a> and teaches at the
        <a href="http://www.englishacousticcollective.org.uk">English Acoustic Collective</a> Summer School.</p>
