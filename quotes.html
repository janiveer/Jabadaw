      <h1>What They Say About Jabadaw</h1>
      <hr size="3"/>
      <section>
        <h2>Live Reviews</h2>
        <p><q>Fast, furious and seriously funky, Jabadaw had everyone’s feet tapping
        by the fourth beat and there was no let up then until they stopped.
        Hailing from Manchester, this five-piece band brought a flavour of
        European folk music to Brampton Live! playing traditional songs from
        England, Norway, and France. The solid sound of bass guitar provided
        the perfect backdrop to the beguiling drone of the hurdy-gurdy and
        smooth sounds of a soprano sax. Taking turns to lead the polkas and
        rondeaux, the band built up layer after layer of sound until the
        audience felt truly loose and lightheaded. Having cut their teeth on
        the wedding and barn dance circuit, Jabadaw are a band who will take
        your feet to the farthest flung corners of any dance floor, and like
        the woman with red shoes, you’ll not be able to stop.</q>

        <h2>CD Reviews</h2>
        <p><q>Hurdy-gurdy, sax, fiddle, bass, drums, Anglo-French repertoire. They inject chunks of
        funk into the tradition and there are definite shades of Le Gop! throughout. Not a
        bad sonic area to inhabit, really. They write a mean tune and they’ve surely got that swing.</q>
        &mdash; <strong>fRoots</strong></p>
        <p><q>And there’s a decided French feel to Jabadaw’s self-titled debut release...
        Their sound, to quote me dear wife Brigid, is somewhere between Blowzabella and the
        Moving Hearts in their instrumental persona. Now given that they play <cite>New French Polkas</cite>
        on this CD that sounds like it could have been written by the blokes in Blowzabella,
        this is not a surprise. Other French cuts on this exemplary CD include
        <cite>Bourr&eacute;e Droite / Bour&eacute;e &agrave; 3 Temps</cite>,
        <cite>Larid&eacute; &agrave; 6 Temps / Hanter Dro</cite> and
        <cite>Da&ntilde;s-Tro Plinn</cite>. Like Anchovy Cappuccino, this uptempo dance music
        that is best played loud. (Me neighbours in the flat below are out for the afternoon,
        so only our felines are ’round to hear this!)
        ’Tis interesting to note the blokes consider themselves to be a
        ceilidh band! Now if you can tell a ceilidh band from a band dance group from an
        American contra dance band from a Breizh fez noz group, you are doing better than this
        fiddler is. All I know is that Jabadaw would be a pleasure to play with on a long summer
        evening when the dancers are ready to do a Halfe Hannikin in the proper fashion!</q>
